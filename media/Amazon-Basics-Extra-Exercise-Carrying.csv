1,        The product was very soft and supported the knees well at first but had no grip from the start Any hint of sweat and I was slipping off the mat 4 months later the mat lost all bounce and my hands and knees would make deep dents and the mat would not regain shape for a long timeNot recommended  
5,               
2,        Too large to carry Very long when spread Can make two pcs out of it

1,        the product shows that it has a holder but it comes without and it is so thick that it looks like a tire when loose without holder cant bring it with me  
5,        Simply amazing  
2,        didnot recieved the strap its thickness is good but its too thick for doing standing asanas on it product has a smell of kind of cheap plastic after doing exercise smell also creeps into your cloths  
3,        I thought good but after a few month I stretch in the cobra pose and my knee made a hole   
5,        Simply amazing

1,        the product arrived without carrying strips that was main reason i purchased it so i requested return of the item  
5,        Excellent qualityabsolutely value for money  
2,        Pro Very soft for your feet and extra thickCon  Absolutely no grip and I keep falling down while doing stretches in this Now I am using this with an old mat below this one and somehow this balances  
3,        The product arrived without carrying strips its very sad because its uncomfortable to use  
5,        Excellent qualityabsolutely value for money

1,        Not nice  
5,        I like it its very comfortable and softand the size as well is recommended  
2,        I really cant stand this mat It works ok on a very flat hard industrial carpet like at our school where I workout sometimes But when I take it home and use it on wood floor than it slips If I put it on a fluffy rug in my room it bunches up weird under my feet and slips If I  put it on the tiles in my basement it slips and slides and even stretches as I do yoga and push out with my hands into planks and chaturangaIts very annoying So theres really only one place Ive not minded using this matNow it is pretty thick and soft so if all youre doing is stretching on it slowly or on your knees or butt thats fine But you start doing a vinyasa flow and the dang thing shifts all over the place It also looks like crap really quick too I am not hard on it at all and its gotten dings and dents in it somehowI gave it 2 stars for its squishiness  But its basically useless for me due to its being so slippery on most of my home surfacesIt is also not very grippy on the top for sticking my feet and hands in yoga poses I had a huge gorilla mat a long time for working out on Its not portable but that thing is amazing with grip and steadiness on hard surfacesSo I am going to try to find a portable mat like that bc this one is just not doing it for me  
3,        The first couple of weeks it looks normal but after that it starts to peal off   
5,        Simply amazing  
4,        Great nonslipppery heavy and comfortable Yoga mat been trying out some Kamasutra positions and the product has totally held up  
4,        gets the job done  
1,        Product reached defective hence returned The size on picture looks thick but its very light and will get torn easily Not recommend to buy  
5,        Enough thicknessMore than enough lengthAlso very good qualityHighly recommended  
2,        I have used this for DDP Yoga and it isnt that good for yoga I got this mat because it was a longer mat with a low price When I was looking for a new mat the mats were mostly short for my 511 height This is almost long enough for me to fully lay down or get a good seated fold While the mat is soft and has more give which is good for hardwood stone and concrete It is easy to move and slip with Second Ive had this mat for about a month and it has some considerable scuffing from a month of use Third there is not much grip with the mat If you want grip and use this mat get a yoga towel to go with it Another good thing is a very good strap to hold it together I happen to like this strap that most others Ive had with my different mats over the yearsWould I get this again likely no That said it isnt completely horrible I just wish there was a mix of padding length and grip This has two out of the three but not the grip which is important with yoga I feel this is a better mat for pilates or general working out not yoga  
3,        It is soft and nice but very fragile in terms of quality  
3,        I had purple yoga mat and liked it very much especially its thickness so ordered red one 2nd time However they shipped me the one with dent mark Dont think they checked the quality before shippingwish I could attach a photo to share but looks like they dont keep such a menu
