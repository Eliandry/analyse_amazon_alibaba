2,        After the first time use it has punctuated just from my nail  
2,        Poor quality may  not worth the money As soon as you do anything on it its scuffed and ruined and using a yoga wheel marks the whole thing Ive even got permanent toes marks printed in this in a few weeks   
4,        I love it Colour and lines Doesnt smell But it is tearable  
3,        A bit  
1,        The markings on the mat are wonky Also the surface isnt great as my hands are slipping I will be returning Totally disappointed  
2,        I like the colur and the design But it is slippery so cant use much  
4,        Its a good product for the price  
3,        It is a good product the material is good Overall experience is also fine

5,        Good quality Worth the price

4,        It serves the purpose and doesnt slip on the floor  
3,        Very slippery surface Design is amazing however I expected it to be more rubbery to stick to the floor which is not the case If you use it on tiles or wooden flor it is so easy to slip  
1,        I did not expect such poor quality after few uses its getting torn For regular use please invest something on good yoga mat

3,        The mat was delivered on time The quality of the mat is good and the colour green I ordered is of a very pleasing shade However the bag that came along with the mat is of a very poor quality It was already ripped at the corner where the stitching ends I have attached the photos Hoping the quality of the mat is improvement for longer use

5,        For the price it was I was so impressed Really thick and comfy to do work outs on

3,        This mat is comfortable but unfortunately my hands slip in mountain and down ward dog pose I thought the color from the photos was more of a mint aqua but its more of a green color

4,        Ive only used the mat a few times I bought it as a yoga mat Its thicker than I expected and than my old mat and took some getting used to Its also not as wide and long as I wanted Im quite tall 177cm so a longer mat is preferred It definitely doesnt slip on the floor and I like the carry bag and colour  
3,        I imagined a kind of warm pastel colour but its more like bright green Even my camera did not catch the really colour that I could seeBack side is plain and light greyQuality seems not really bad just got what I paid
